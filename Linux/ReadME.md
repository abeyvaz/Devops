🐧 Linux System Administration & Automation

🚀 Project: DevOps Linux Server Monitoring & Automation
Imagine you're managing a Linux-based production server. Your goal is to ensure that users, logs, and processes are well-managed — just like a real DevOps engineer.

In this hands-on project, you'll work through practical, real-world system administration tasks: user management, permission control, log analysis, volume mounting, process monitoring, and automation.
